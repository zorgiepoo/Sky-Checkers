This document is for building Sky Checkers from source. Available binaries are at https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Sky-Checkers/releases

To compile under macOS or iOS, build and run the Xcode project in mac/ using the appropriate scheme
To compile under Windows, build and run the Visual Studio project in win/ using the appropriate configuration

To compile for linux, the following dependencies are needed:

* SDL2 (Windows, Linux)
* SDL2_ttf (Linux)
* SDL2_mixer (Linux)
* glew (Linux)

On Linux, development libraries for these dependencies may need to first be installed.

Eg: On Ubuntu, I had to execute:

apt-get install libsdl2-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
apt-get install libglew-dev

On CentOS 7, I executed:

yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
yum install epel-release
yum install SDL2-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_mixer-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_ttf-devel.x86_64
yum install glew-devel.x86_64.

Then to compile under Linux, cd into linux/ and:
  1. If you want to build and install a production build run:
     make
     sudo make install
     This will install /usr/bin/skycheckers on your system along with a desktop entry
  2. If you want to make a development build run:
     make scdev
     This will output a scdev executable in the current directory that can be executed.
