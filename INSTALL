Sky Checkers relies on the following dependencies:

* SDL2 (Windows, Linux)
* SDL2_mixer (Windows, Linux)
* SDL2_ttf (Windows, Linux)
* glew (Linux)

On Linux, development libraries for these dependencies may need to first be installed.

Eg: On Ubuntu, I had to execute:

apt-get install libsdl2-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
apt-get install libglew-dev

On CentOS 7, I executed:

yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
yum install epel-release
yum install SDL2-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_mixer-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_ttf-devel.x86_64
yum install glew-devel.x86_64

For Windows, these dependencies are bundled in the source code already.
For macOS and iOS, no major dependencies are used.

To compile under macOS or iOS, build and run the Xcode project in mac/ using the appropriate scheme
To compile under Windows, build and run the Visual Studio project in win/ using the appropriate scheme
To compile under Linux, cd into linux and:
  1. If you want to build development build run:
     make scdev
     This will output a scdev executable that can be ran.
  2. If you want to build and install a production build run:
     make
     sudo make install
     This will install skycheckers on your system with a desktop entry and executable in /usr/bin/
