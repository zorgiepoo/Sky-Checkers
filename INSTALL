Sky Checkers relies on the following dependencies:

* SDL2
* SDL2_image
* SDL2_mixer
* SDL2_ttf
* SDL2_image

On Linux, development libraries for these dependencies may need to first be installed.

Eg: On Ubuntu, I had to execute:

apt-get install libsdl2-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
apt-get install libglew-dev

On CentOS, I executed:

yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
yum install epel-release
yum install SDL2-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_mixer-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_ttf-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL2_image-devel.x86_64
yum install glew-devel.x86_64

For macOS and Windows, these dependencies are bundled in the source code already.

To compile under macOS, build and run the Xcode project in mac/
To compile under Windows, build and run the Visual Studio project in win/
To compile under Linux, execute make and it will output a skycheckers executable.
