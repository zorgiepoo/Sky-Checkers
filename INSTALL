Sky Checkers relies on the following dependencies:

* SDL 1.2
* SDL_image 1.2 (1.2.10 is the latest that works properly on macOS)
* SDL_mixer 1.2
* SDL_ttf 2.0 (for SDL 1.2)
* SDL_image 1.2
* FreeGLUT (for Windows and Linux)

On Linux, development libraries for these dependencies may need to first be installed.

Eg: On Ubuntu, I had to execute:

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev
apt-get install freeglut3-dev

On CentOS, I executed:

yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
yum install epel-release
yum install SDL-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL_mixer-devel.x86_64
yum install SDL_ttf-devel.x86_64
yum install freeglut-devel.x86_64

For macOS and Windows, these dependencies are bundled in the source code already.

To compile under macOS, build and run the Xcode project in mac/
To compile under Windows, build and run the Visual Studio project in win/
To compile under Linux, execute make and it will output a skycheckers executable.
