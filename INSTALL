This document is for building Sky Checkers from source. Available binaries are at https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Sky-Checkers/releases

To compile under macOS or iOS, build and run the Xcode project in mac/ using the appropriate scheme
To compile under Windows, build and run the Visual Studio project in win/ using the appropriate configuration

To compile for linux, the following dependencies are needed to be installed:

* SDL3 (3.4.0)
* SDL3_ttf (3.3.2)
* SDL3_mixer (dbadac0d8aef1eb1de3cf1eff9ffccea8d65f21c)

These releases are obtained from GitHub repositories with following cmake steps:

```
cd $SDL_PROJ_DIR
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
cmake --build . --parallel
sudo cmake --install .
```

Then to compile under Linux, cd into linux/ and:
  1. If you want to build and install a production build run:
     make
     sudo make install
     This will install /usr/bin/skycheckers on your system along with a desktop entry
  2. If you want to make a development build run:
     make scdev
     This will output a scdev executable in the current directory that can be executed.
