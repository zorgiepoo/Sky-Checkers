Sky Checkers relies on the following dependencies:

* SDL 1.2
* SDL_image 1.2 (1.2.10 is the latest that works properly on macOS)
* SDL_mixer 1.2
* SDL_ttf 2.0 (for SDL 1.2)
* SDL_image 1.2
* GLUT

On Linux, development libraries for these dependencies may need to first be installed.

Eg: On Ubuntu, I had to execute:

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev
apt-get install freeglut3-dev

For macOS and Windows, these dependencies are bundled in the source code already.

To compile under macOS, build and run the project using Xcode.
To compile under Linux, execute make and it will output a skycheckers executable.

Building on Windows is not straightforward. I set up a Dev-C++ project a long time ago that used minGW.
