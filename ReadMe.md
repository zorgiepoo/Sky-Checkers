## Introduction
Sky Checkers is a multiplayer game based on an old N64 Kirby mini-game. Knock off your enemies and be the last one standing!

Sky Checkers supports macOS, Windows, and Linux. Downloads can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Sky-Checkers/releases). For information on compiling the latest changes from source, please see [INSTALL](INSTALL).

This game was originally written during my high school years. Recently, I've rewritten the renderer and netcode in addition to making other enhancements. Thus, the releases page may lag behind current development quite a bit.

## Features

* 3D graphics supporting OpenGL and Metal backends (in the master branch)
* Local or [online (no audio)](https://zgcoder.net/zfw/skycheckers_play_noaudio.mov) battles with 1 - 4 players
* Bots with an easy, medium, or hard difficulty
* Gamepad support
* [Console](https://zgcoder.net/software/skycheckers/images/console.png) for development & debugging

## Licensing

The source code is currently licensed under the GPL version 3.

The assets are licensed differently. I acquired [an embedded app license](http://typodermicfonts.com/goodfish/) for the goodfish font that only I can use and which is obfuscated in the code. Sound assets except for the main menu music are freely distributed from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) and [PacDV](http://www.pacdv.com/sounds/).

All other assets (main menu music, textures) were developed by a friend and me solely for this project, and are not otherwise freely licensed.
