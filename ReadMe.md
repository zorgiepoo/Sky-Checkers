This game is based on an old N64 Kirby mini-game and was originally written during my high school years, but still kept up to date ❤️.

## Licensing

The source code (including OpenGL shaders) is licensed under the GPL version 3. In the unanticipated event contributions are made, I may need to extend the license. I plan to put some parts of the code under a more permissive license eventually.

The assets are licensed differently. I acquired [an embedded app license](http://typodermicfonts.com/goodfish/) for the goodfish font that only I can use. Sound assets except for main_menu.wav and dieing_stone.wav are freely distributed from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) and [PacDV](http://www.pacdv.com/sounds/). The cracked texture tile effect is acquired from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/cracked-texture-overlay-distressed-1975573/). I acquired game controller mappings from [SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB) with some of my own alterations.

The main menu music is royalty free because it's mostly derived from a Garageband loop. The dieing_stone.wav effect I recorded and the [whoosh.wav effect](https://freesound.org/people/petenice/sounds/9509) are under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The app icon images, this ReadMe, INSTALL, Changelog are licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Metadata files for Linux (desktop entry, com.zgcoder.skycheckers.json, snapcraft.yaml, AppData file) are freely licensed under [FSFAP](https://spdx.org/licenses/FSFAP.html).

The Texture assets (Data/Textures) were developed by a friend and I solely for this project, and are not freely licensed.
