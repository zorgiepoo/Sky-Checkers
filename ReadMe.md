This game is based on an old N64 Kirby mini-game and was originally written during my high school years, but still kept up to date ❤️.

## Licensing

The source code is currently licensed under the GPL version 3. In the unanticipated event contributions are made, I may have to extend/alter the license. I plan to put some parts of the code under a more permissive license eventually.

The assets are licensed differently. I acquired [an embedded app license](http://typodermicfonts.com/goodfish/) for the goodfish font that only I can use. Sound assets except for the main menu music are freely distributed from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) and [PacDV](http://www.pacdv.com/sounds/). The cracked texture tile effect is acquired from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/cracked-texture-overlay-distressed-1975573/). I acquired game controller mappings from [SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB) with some of my own alterations.

All other assets (main menu music, textures) were developed by a friend and I solely for this project, and are not otherwise freely licensed.
