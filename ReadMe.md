## Introduction
Sky Checkers is a multiplayer video game I wrote during my high school and early college years. It is based on an old N64 Kirby mini-game. Knock off your enemies and the last one standing wins.

The quality of the code may reflect what I consider my first real project. This project serves mainly for historical value now, and may not compile on some platforms and toolsets as-is.

Sky Checkers supports macOS, Windows, and Linux. Distributed binaries can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/zorgiepoo/Sky-Checkers/releases).

## Features

* 3D graphics written using OpenGL
* Local or [online](https://zgcoder.net/software/skycheckers/images/skycheckers_ubuntu_and_osx.png) battles with 1 - 4 players (online uses port 4893 over UDP)
* AI bots with an easy, medium, or hard difficulty
* Gamepad support
* [Console](https://zgcoder.net/software/skycheckers/images/console.png) for development & debugging

## Licensing

The source code is licensed under the GPL, and borrows some external (L)GPL or public domain code which is commented appropriately.

The assets are licensed differently. I acquired [an embedded app license](http://typodermicfonts.com/goodfish/) for the goodfish font that only I can use and which is obfuscated in the code. Sound assets except for the main menu music are freely distributed from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) and [PacDV](http://www.pacdv.com/sounds/).

All other assets (main menu music, textures) were developed by a friend and me solely for this project, and are not otherwise freely licensed.
